<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail" style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-right: 8px;" alt="Ray Cardillo" src="/images/Ray-Cardillo-BW.jpg" width="150" height="150" />My name is Ray Cardillo and I established Cardillo&#8217;s Creations as an indie software company in 2008.  I am a one man shop, but I&#8217;m unofficially supported by family and friends.  I am already an accomplished software engineer, and I am always dedicated to my full-time job, so this is more of a hobby for me than anything else.  Calling it a hobby is a little odd given the number of hours that I spend creating and supporting my projects, but it really is a form of recreation for me, so I&#8217;m alright with that.  Some people work on classic cars or build models&#8230; I do that kinda stuff as well&#8230; but mostly I do this.</p>
