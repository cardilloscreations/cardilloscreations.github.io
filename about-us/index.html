<p>Hello, my name is Ray Cardillo, and I established Cardillo&#8217;s Creations as an indie software company in 2008.  I am a one man shop, but I&#8217;m unofficially supported by family and friends.  I am a professional software engineer and technical leader, but I enjoy creating apps and tinkering with technology when time permits.</p>

<p>I am always dedicated to my full-time job, so this is more of a hobby for me than anything else.  Calling it a hobby is a little odd given the number of hours that I spend creating and supporting my projects, but it really is a form of recreation for me, so I&#8217;m alright with that.  Some people work on classic cars or build models&#8230; I do that kinda stuff as well&#8230; but mostly I do this.
