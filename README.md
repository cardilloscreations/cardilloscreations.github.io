# Data for the Cardillo's Creations Website

This content is transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
into a static site whenever I push this repository to [GitHub](http://github.com).

Thanks to GitHub, I'm able to host this website for free, and have backups and
version control. Static content is not for everyone, but it's perfect for a
blogs and websites like this.

### Warning - Work In Progress

Please do not use this site as an example of best practices with Jekyll. I had
to rush through a manual recovery operation to rebuild the site from a snapshot on
[archive.org](archive.org) after I accidentally lost my hosting account during a relocation. The site was a Wordpress site with a commercial theme and lots of extras so I'm slowly updating it to follow best practices as I need more going forward. In the
meantime, it's more of a mashup than a properly designed Jekyll site.
